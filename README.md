# openmc-benchmarking-scripts
A collection of scripts I have put together to help me get setup on a new GPU system and start benchmarking as quickly as possible. 

Scripts included:
-
- Build scripts for OpenMC (not the most general but gives me a starting point)
- Build scripts for LLVM (should I need to build llvm from source)
- Slurm submission scripts for benchmarks (including array jobs)
- Python post processing scripts
- Shell scripts to setup respositories with OpenMC xml inputs ready for slurm submission
- Any miscellaneous helper scripts I have found useful
